# <dependent> properties file for spring Java Skirmish AIs
# This is used when you do not use the spring repository for compiling.
#
# Paths are relative to the project home (which is ../ from this file).
# All values are optional, and listed here with their defaults.
#
# The <dependent> default assumes that you have the spring source,
# and do a spring in-source build as it is the default with CMake and SCons,
# and as the buildbot does it.
#
# build-dir:    ${spring.home}/AI/Skirmish/${ai.name}/
# install-dir:  ${spring.home}/game/AI/Skirmish/${ai.name}/${ai.version}/
#
# This file is loaded from within build.xml,
# but only if no "jlibs-interface/" dir is present.
