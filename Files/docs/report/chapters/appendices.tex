Figure \ref{fig:task_system_class_diagram} shows the central parts of the task system. Some of the
functionality has been described in \ref{sec:task_system}, thus this figure is mostly for
enlighten and gather all the functionality in one place. For a complete documentation on the API we
refer to the \href{http://alice.dmgame.org/doxygen/}{javadoc} documentation. If the page is off-line
or isn't available it could have been moved, please email on of the authors \authornames.
